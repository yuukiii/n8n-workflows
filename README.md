# 🧠 n8n Workflow Collection

This repository contains a collection of **n8n workflows** gathered from multiple sources, including:

* Workflows exported from the [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) website and community forum
* Publicly shared examples found across the web (GitHub, blogs, etc.)

The goal is to provide a useful resource for inspiration, learning, and reuse in your own n8n projects.

## 📂 Folder Structure

* Each `.json` file represents a single exported workflow.
* Files are named either based on their original title or source.
* You may also find `.txt` files that were converted into `.json` (see below).

---

## 🔄 TXT to JSON Conversion

Some workflows were originally saved as `.txt` files or copied from online sources. A script was used to:

* Detect `.txt` files
* Attempt to parse them as JSON or structured key-value pairs
* Convert them to valid `.json` format

If you’re looking to run the conversion yourself, check out `convert_txt_to_json.py` included in this repo.
